# The Unix Philosophy

* The underlying principle behind many programs used for routine tasks
* Unix philosophy is that a program should do one thing, and do it well
* Programs should use text-interfaces: should take in text and output text
* Tools shouldn't try to do too much; instead, tools should be modular and atomistic so that they can be recombined to perform any series of operations you need to perform
* Standard GNU tools follow the Unix philosophy
* Swiss army knife example: a Swiss army knife has many tools, but none of them work very well
* GNU standard command line programs are like a kitchen full of high-quality utensils that each do a single thing really well
* Modularity and flexibility are features, not limitations, of working at the command line
