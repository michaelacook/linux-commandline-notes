# Editing Text with Nano

* On some Linux distributions and on Mac OS there is a text editor called Nano which is simpler and easier to use than Vim
* Easier, but lacks some features that Vim supports
* To start Nano run `$ nano` or to open a file run `$ nano [arg file]`

## Shortcuts

* `ctrl` + `a`: move to beginning of line
* `ctrl` + `e`: move to end of line
* `ctrl` + `o`: save
* `ctrl` + `w`: search for text
* `ctrl` + `v`: move down one screen
* `ctrl` + `y`: move up one screen
* Other shortcuts are listed on the bottom of the screen
* (reminder: `^` stands for the `ctrl` key)
