# File Permissions

* On Linux, files generally have three sets of permissions that apply to the user, group, and all others in that order
* Permissions refer to a user, group, or other's ability to read, write, and execute a file:
* **Read**: read the file but not write
* **Write**: change the file but not read
* **Execute**: run the file without loading it to another program
* (note: a file is executable when it can be run without being loaded into another program)
* The permissions for a file can be viewed by running `$ ls -l [file]`
* Permissions are displayed symbolically or with octal digits, and they always either take the form of three digits or groups of three characters
* E.g `-rwxrwxrwx`
* In the example above, each section has three letters representing the permissions granted to each entity. In this case it is read, write and execute for all three: user, group, and others
* In octal form, the same permission would read `777` with each digit representing a combination of permissions for each entity
* Permissions can be changed with the `$ chmod [permission] [arg file]` command
* Because directories are also files, they also have permissions
* Reading a directory means listing the files and metadata in the directory 
* Writing to the directory means putting new files in it 
* Executing a directory means entering and traversing it

## Octal Permissions

* When representing permissions using octal notation, permissions take the form of three digits, each digit representing the read, write and execute permissions for each entity: user, group, others
* Each digit is the sum of the three digits that respectively represent a permission
* **read** = 4, **write** = 2, **execute** = 1
* Therefore, if a file can be read, altered, and executed by the user but no one else, it's octal permission would be 700: \
(4 + 2 + 1) + 0 + 0
* E.g to change the permissions for a file called `example.txt` to allow read, write, execute for users, read and execute for the group, and read only for all others, you would run the following:
`$ chmod 754 example.txt`


### Octal File Permissions
|    | Read (4) | Write (2) | Execute (1) | Result |
| -- | -- | ----- | ------- |  ------  |
| User | r | w | x |  7  |
| Group | r | - | x | 5 |
| Others | r | - | - | 4 |

### Octal Values
| Octal Value | Mode | Octal Value | Mode |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | ---- |
| 0 | - - - | 4 | r - - |
| 1 | - - x | 5 | r - x |
| 2 | - w - | 6 | r w - |
| 3 | - w x | 7 | r w x |

## Symbolic Permissions

* When you view permissions for a file, they usually display symbolically by default
* Instead of the permissions for each entity being represented by a single digit, the permissions for each entity, user, group, others, are represented by a combination of up to three symbols: **r** for read, **w** for write, **x** for execute, **-** for no permission
* Each symbolic permission is a string of nine characters not including the dash at the eginning (which indicates the entity is a file)
* E.g `-rwxr--r--` means the user can read, write and execute, the group can read but nothing else, and others can read but nothing else
* Changing permissions with symbolic notation is a bit different from using octal notation
* When using symbolic notation, each entity is specified individually
* **u** stands for user, **g** stands for group, **o** stands for others, **a** stands for all
* A '+' sign is used to add a permission, a '-' sign is used to subtract a permission, and the '=' sign is used to set a permission and erase any others
* E.g if `example.txt` has a permission of `-rwxrw-r--` and we want to change its permissions to 1. take away execution powers for the user, 2. take away writing power for the group, and add execution and write power for all others, we would run the following command:
`$ chmod u-x,g-w,o+wx`
* Permissions for entities can be changed individually as well E.g `$ chmod u=r example.txt`
* This will change only the user's permission but not the group or others
* Using the = sign will erase any other permissions already set and replace them with the permission you specify, so if you want to add or subtract a permission without affecting others use the '+' or '-' signs


### Symbolic File Permissions
|    | Read (r) | Write (w) | Execute (x) | Result |
| -- | -- | ----- | ------- |  ------  |
| User (u) | + | + | + |  u+rwx  |
| Group (g) | = | - | - | g=r |
| Others (o) | - | - | - | o-rwx |
| All (a) |  |  |  |  |

\+ adds permission; - removes permissions;
= adds permission but removes others


### Comparing Octal and Symbolic Values
| Octal Value | Symbolic Value | Result |
|-------------|----------------|--------|
| 777 | a+rwx | rwxrwxrwx |
| 755 | u+rwx, g=rx, o=rx | rwxr-xr-x |
| 644 | u=rw, g=r, o=r | rw-r--r-- |
| 700 | u=rwx, g-rwx, o-rwx | rwx------ |

## File and Group Ownership

* In the long form `ls` there are two columns that show the user and group ownership for each file
* The username in the first column owns the file and is the entity for which the first set of permissions for a file apply to
* The group owner is the second column and the permissions in the second part of a permission apply to that group
* Can change the ownership of a file using the `$ chown [username] [arg file]` command
* To change the ownership on all files in a directory you can use the recursive option: 
  * `chown -R user1:user1 /home/user1` 
  * This will set all files in a user's home directory as belonging to them and their group
* E.g `$ sudo chown root example.txt` will change the ownership of the file to the root user
* `sudo` has to be used because you need root privileges to change a file to root ownership
* You can change the group that the file belongs to using the `$ chgrp [groupname] [arg file]` command

## Initial Permissions using umask
- When files are created initial permissions are assigned automatically
- They are calculated based bitmask called *umask* 
- View the umask with the command `umask` and use the `-S` option for symbolic representation
- umask can have three or four characters 
- The umask literally masks the initial permissions. To get the initial directory permissions from the umask subtract the umask value from 777 
- To get the initial file permissions subtract the umask value from 666
  - Executable permissions are not enabled on files by default
- To change the umask run the command `umask [new umask value]`
  - This only works for the current login session
  - To persist the change it must be added to the `bashrc` file
  - Add the command to change the umask to the bashrc file the same as you would on the terminal
- To change the system-wide umask, change into `/etc/profile.d` and add a file called `umask.sh` 
  - In the file add: 

  ```bash 
  if [ "$UID" -ge 1000 ] ;then 
        umask 0002 
  fi
  ```

## Special Bits: SUID & SGID
- Additional permission bits for permissions on executable files and directories 
- Files:
  - Set user ID (SUID) - run executable as user owner of the file 
  - Set group ID (SGID) - run executable as group owner of the file
  - Sticky - Unix only - make an executable remain in swap memory to execute faster
    - Not functional in Linux on files 
  - When there is an `s` in the user owner permissions it means the SUID bit is set; when it is lowercase, the SUID bit is set; when it's uppercase, it is not
    - `-rwsr-xr-x`
    - `-rwSr-xr-x`
  - The same applies when the `s` is present in the group owner permissions
  - The SUID bit has a numeric value of 4 and is prepended to the regular numeric permission value 
    - ie. `sudo chmod 4755 file.txt` 
  - Symbolic mode can also be used: `sudo chmod u+s file.txt`
  - The SGID bit has a numeric value of 2 and is prepended to the reuglar numeric permission value 
    - ie. `sudo chmod 2755 file.txt` or `sudo chmod g+s file.txt`
- You may want to know where files with elevated executable permissions are in the filesystem for security reasons
  - run `sudo find / -perm -4000` to find all files with the SUID bit set 
  - run `sudo find / -perm -2000` to find all files with the SGID bit set
- Directories: 
  - SUID has no effect on directories 
  - SGID provides group inheritance on files and dirs created inside the directory
  - Sticky can be set on directories
  - Add a sticky bit to a directory's permissions by prepending it's numeric permission value with 1
    - ie. `sudo chmod 1777 stickydir/`
  - This prevents users from moving and deleting each other's files
  - Generally used for world-writable directories like `/tmp`
