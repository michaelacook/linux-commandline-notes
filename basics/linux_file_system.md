# Linux File System

* Most Linux distributions follow a standard filesystem structure called the  **Filesystem Hierarchy Standard**
* This standard defines common locations for files on the filesystem
* Having certain files in predictable locations is important for software to work across different Linux distros

## Common Parts of a Linux Filesystem

| / | root (highest level of filesystem hierarchy) |
| - | -------------------------------------------- |
| home | stores user home folders |
| root | stores root's (super-user) home folder |
| etc | configuration files for many tools |
| bin | stores binaries (programs) |
| sbin | stores binaries (programs) |
| lib | libraries and shared modules |
| dev | represents devices on the system |
| mnt | where local and remote filesystems are mounted |
| media | where removable storage is mounted |
| proc | virtual filesystem representing processes |
| sys | virtual filesystem representing kernel values |
