# Command Line Basics

This set of notes is based on the Linkedin Learning course [Learning Linux command line](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/learning-linux-command-line-2/learning-linux-command-line).
I have meticulously taken notes on all video lessons and made examples for the first section of the course, and the rest is soon to come.
This set of notes can be used alongside the course, as an independent tutorial, or as a refresher. If you are completely new to using the command line, I recommend using these notes alongside the course on Linkedin Learning or another introductory command line course.
